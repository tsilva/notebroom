### DEPRECATED FILE ###

This file has been replaced with a new system prompt structure:

1. base_system_prompt.txt - Contains common instructions about notebook structure and formatting
2. [pass]_prompt.txt files - Contain specific instructions for each improvement pass

The code now combines these files at runtime rather than using a placeholder in this file.

See the run_improvement_pass function in main.py for implementation details.
