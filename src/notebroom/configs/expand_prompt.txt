### üîç Conceptual Expansion Pass

For this pass, focus on **expanding conceptual understanding** in markdown cells:

#### üéØ Specific Goals:
- Add **minimal but meaningful clarifications** to fully explain concepts
- Briefly explain the **purpose of each step or command** in code-related explanations
- Provide **context for why** certain techniques or approaches are being used
- Fill in **missing conceptual links** that would help learners understand the material better

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints:
- Do **not** add new sections or headings
- Only improve content inside existing cells
- Keep expansions **concise and targeted**
- Focus on **quality over quantity** - only add information that significantly improves understanding
- Maintain the **original structure** and flow of the notebook

#### üìê Success Criteria:
- Each markdown cell should provide a complete understanding of the related concepts
- A novice in the field should be able to follow the explanation
- Added clarifications should seamlessly integrate with the existing content
